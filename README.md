# Customer Value Segmentation & Revenue Behaviour Analysis for E-Commerce Growth

## Executive Summary
This project was done to support strategic decision-making for an e-commerce business with limited customer insights and unclear revenue drivers. I analyzed and transformed 42,992 rows of raw transactional data after taking necessary steps to check for missing values, nulls, outliers, to uncover patterns in purchase behaviour, segment customer value using RFM scoring, and investigate performance across age brackets and countries. The analysis revealed key demographic segments, seasonal trends, and underperforming categories, helping to shape customer targeting, product strategy and retention efforts.

### 📈 Key Objectives

- Segment customers based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores to identify top-value, potential, and low-engagement groups.

- Analyze revenue contributions by age group, country, and product category.

- Detect seasonal trends and changes in revenue timing from 2023 to 2025.

- Recommend actionable strategies based on findings to increase loyalty and revenue.

- In Brazil, customers aged 25–44 outspent all other age groups, both within the country and across other countries, making them the most valuable demographic segment.

- Further analysis shows their high spending and purchase frequency were primarily driven by book purchases.

- Books generated the highest overall revenue, while beauty products contributed the least. France led in total revenue, with clothing as the top-performing category, indicating high spending on clothes. In contrast, toys underperformed. In Canada, books drove the highest sales and customer interest, while beauty products had the lowest engagement.

- Revenue peaked in January 2024 and January 2025, signalling a shift from mid-year (July 2023) to early-year demand.

- Payment method preference showed significant skew, suggesting opportunities for promotional alignment.

####  Recommendations

- Launch Q1-focused campaigns to capitalise on early-year demand.

- Launch targeted digital ad campaigns, exclusive discounts, and loyalty perks for Brazil’s 25–44 age group, focusing on social media and email to drive conversions and repeat purchases.

- Promote books specifically to the 25–44 demographic through personalised offers and ads on high-traffic platforms to sustain engagement and maximise revenue growth.

- Expand high-performing product categories (clothing in France, books in Canada) and re-evaluate low-performing ones.

- Use refined customer segmentation to personalise offers and reduce churn.

- Most customers prefer to pay with cash when the item is delivered, rather than using digital methods like cards or transfers. This may mean they don’t fully trust the online payment system or find it hard to use.
