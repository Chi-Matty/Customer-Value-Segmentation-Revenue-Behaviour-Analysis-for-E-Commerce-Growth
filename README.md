# Customer Value Segmentation & Revenue Behaviour Analysis for E-Commerce Growth
This project was done to support strategic decision-making for an e-commerce business with limited customer insights and unclear revenue drivers. I analyzed and transformed 42,992 rows of raw transactional data after taking necessary steps to check for missing values, nulls, outliers, to uncover patterns in purchase behaviour, segment customer value using RFM scoring, and investigate performance across age brackets and countries. The analysis revealed key demographic segments, seasonal trends, and underperforming categories, helping to shape customer targeting, product strategy and retention efforts.

### 📈 Key Objectives

- Segment customers based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores to identify top-value, potential, and low-engagement groups.

- Analyze revenue contributions by age group, country, and product category.

- Detect seasonal trends and changes in revenue timing from 2023 to 2025.

- Recommend actionable strategies based on findings to increase loyalty and revenue.

### 📊 Key Insights

- RFM analysis revealed that 40% of customers are top performers with strong loyalty and consistent high spend.

- The 25–44 age group led revenue generation, particularly in Brazil.

- Across all countries, the 25–44 age group made the most frequent purchases and generated the highest revenue. Deeper analysis reveals that their spending and purchase frequency were primarily driven by book purchases, making them the most valuable demographic segment.

- Books generated the highest overall revenue, while beauty products contributed the least. France led in total revenue, with clothing as the top-performing category, indicating high spending on clothes. In contrast, toys underperformed. In Canada, books drove the highest sales and customer interest, while beauty products had the lowest engagement.

- Revenue peaked in January 2024 and January 2025, signalling a shift from mid-year (July 2023) to early-year demand.

- Payment method preference showed significant skew, suggesting opportunities for promotional alignment.

####  Recommendations

- Launch Q1-focused campaigns to capitalise on early-year demand.

- Reward top customers with loyalty incentives; re-target potential customers with frequency boosters.

- Focus on Brazil’s 25–44 demographic using digital ads and email marketing.

- Expand high-performing product categories (clothing in France, books in Canada) and re-evaluate low-performing ones.

- Use refined customer segmentation to personalise offers and reduce churn.
