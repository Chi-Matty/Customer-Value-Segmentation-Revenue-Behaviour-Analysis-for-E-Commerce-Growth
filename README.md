# E-commerce_Analysis
This project explores customer purchase behaviour using real-world e-commerce transaction data. I performed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers, and conducted age group segmentation to understand spending patterns across different age brackets and countries. Key insights include top spending age groups, revenue distribution, and customer value tiers. 

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
	•	Python
	•	pandas
	•	matplotlib
	•	seaborn
	•	Jupyter Notebook

 ### 🔍 Objectives
	•	Segment customers based on RFM values
	•	Analyse customer behaviour by age and geography
	•	Identify high-value customer groups and spending trends

### 📈 Insights & Recommendations

#### Insights:
	•	Customers aged 25–44 generated the highest revenue.
	•	Top 20% of customers accounted for over 60% of revenue.
	•	Older age groups showed lower frequency but higher average order value.

#### Recommendations:
	•	Focus marketing on top RFM segments and 25–44 age group.
	•	Consider loyalty programs for high-value customers.
	•	Investigate ways to engage low-frequency but high-value age groups.
