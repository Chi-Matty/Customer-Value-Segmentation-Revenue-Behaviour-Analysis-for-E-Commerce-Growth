# E-commerce_Analysis
This project explores customer purchase behaviour using real-world e-commerce transaction data. I performed RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers, and conducted age group segmentation to understand spending patterns across different age brackets and countries. Key insights include top spending age groups, revenue distribution, and customer value tiers.

### Objective:
To identify key revenue drivers and perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis and age brackets, uncovering behavioural patterns in purchasing and spending habits across countries. This analysis also explores product category performance across regions to optimise marketing strategies, improve inventory planning, enhance customer engagement, and ultimately boost sales and retention.

### ðŸ“ˆ Insights & Recommendations

#### Insights:
- Revenue peaked in 2024, marking the highest in three years â€” driven by strong performance in January. This early-year trend continued in January 2025. In contrast, July was the top month in 2023, indicating a shift from mid-year to early-year demand and a possible change in customer behaviour or market dynamics.

- RFM analysis revealed that 40% of customers are top performers with high loyalty and spending.

- 45% are potential customers with moderate engagement, offering strong growth opportunities.
  
- The 25â€“44 age group accounted for 39% of purchases and led revenue generation, largely driven by book sales.
  
- In Brazil, customers aged 25â€“44 outspent all other age groups â€” both within the country and across other countries â€” making them the most valuable demographic segment.

- France led in revenue, with clothing as its top category; toys underperformed. Canada had the most customers, with books driving sales and beauty products seeing the least engagement.

#### Recommendations:
- Leverage the early-year demand trend by launching targeted campaigns and promotions in Q1, while reviewing past mid-year strategies to understand and adapt to changing customer behaviour.

- Prioritise top customers with loyalty rewards and personalised offers to sustain retention.

- Target potential customers with tailored promotions to boost their frequency and spending.

- Launch targeted digital ad campaigns, exclusive discounts, and loyalty perks for Brazilâ€™s 25â€“44 age groupâ€”focusing on social medias, and email to drive conversions and repeat purchases.

- Build on the success of high-performing categories by focusing on clothing in France and books in Canada through targeted marketing and inventory planning. To boost weaker segments, consider product repositioning and limited-time offers to improve the performance of toys in France and beauty products in Canada.
